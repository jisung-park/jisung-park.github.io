I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.postech.ac.kr) at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr). Before joining POSTECH, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate and Lecturer in the [Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (D-ITET)](https://ee.ethz.ch) at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://www.ethz.ch), working in [SAFARI Research Group](https://safari.ethz.ch) led by [Prof. Onur Mutlu](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu). I earned my Ph.D. and B.S.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from [Seoul National University (SNU)](https://www.snu.ac.kr). At SNU, I was a member of [Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems Laboratory (CARES)](https://cares.snu.ac.kr) led by [Prof. Jihong Kim](http://cares.snu.ac.kr/?module=Board&action=SiteBoard&sMode=VIEW_FORM&iBrdNo=1&iBrdContNo=84&sBrdContRe=0&sSearchField=&sSearchValue=&CurrentPage=1). My research interests lie in computer architecture, system software, memory systems, storage systems, system security, and hardware/software interaction.
