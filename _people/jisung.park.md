I earned my Ph.D. and B.S.E. degrees from [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr), where I was a member of [Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems Laboratory (CARES)](https://cares.snu.ac.kr) led by [Prof. Jihong Kim](http://cares.snu.ac.kr/?module=Board&action=SiteBoard&sMode=VIEW_FORM&iBrdNo=1&iBrdContNo=84&sBrdContRe=0&sSearchField=&sSearchValue=&CurrentPage=1).
